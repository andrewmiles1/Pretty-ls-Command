# ls_pretty

This was a simple idea I had to make an LS command that listed the files in the current directory with a little more formatting.
The ls command in Linux is already pretty nice and powerful, but this was a nice "can I do it?" project. 

I originally had a lot of ideas with flags/argument options but ran out of time that I had set aside to finish the project. 
What's left is the simple name, size, and last modified version here.
